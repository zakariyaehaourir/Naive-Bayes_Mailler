Subject: Meeting Reminder – Project Update

Hi Sarah,

Just a quick reminder that we have our weekly project update meeting scheduled for tomorrow at 10:00 AM in the main conference room. Please bring the latest version of the report and any notes on the client feedback so we can finalize the next steps.

If you’re unable to attend, let me know and we’ll reschedule.

Best regards,
Michael Johnson
Project Manager
